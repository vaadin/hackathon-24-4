# hackathon-24-4
Repository for the 24.4 hackathon

## What I did

1. I've verified that Karibu-Testing and Karibu-DSL work with Vaadin 24.4.0.beta4
2. I've tested Spring-less setup: I've upgraded https://github.com/mvysny/vaadin-boot-example-maven to Vaadin 24.4.0.beta4 and verified that Flow works even without Spring.
  - I've also tested the Copilot and found it working: the style updates were applied correctly
