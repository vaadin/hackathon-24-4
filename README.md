# Shared TODO list

A Hilla todo list that is updated in real time in all browser windows by combining Flux and Signals.

Just open two different windows and start adding todos and marking them as done. You will see that the changes are reflected in real time in all windows.

# Goal

I wanted to test signals. I thought that using them with Flux would be a good scenario. I found no issues though.
